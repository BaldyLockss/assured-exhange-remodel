    "On receipt of your enquiry, we will conduct some market research relevant to your property, identifying comparable properties that have sold within the last 6-12 months by using data from the wider market to establish a base market value for your property. ",
    "From here, usually within 1 working day, we will get in touch to discuss the specifics of your property. This includes the condition of the property, work you might have had done that could increase the value of your property, and establish a desirable timescale for completion.",
    "Using all this information we will determine our best cash offer; this is typically 85-90% of market value. After you have reviewed this offer and should you accept, we will introduce you to our specialist solicitors who will manage the rest of the sale process. Completion can be arranged on a timescale that is convenient for you."
